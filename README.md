This repository contains files related to the recent re-annotation of Adenovirus strain Ad5 described here - [ bioRxiv ] link

Description of files:

Ad5_v9.1_forward.gff3 - GFF3 file denoting all Ad5 transcripts annotated on the top strand of adenovirus strain Ad5
Ad5_v9.1_reverse.gff3 - GFF3 file denoting all Ad5 transcripts annotated on the top strand of adenovirus strain Ad5
Adenovirus-Ad5-AC_000008.1.fasta - original Ad5 genome sequence (Genbank accession AC_000008.1)

Notes:

Users should ensure the header line in the genome fasta file matches the text used in column #1 of the GFF3 files prior to perform alignment and any downstream analyses
